class WarmstartedRandomForestWithInstances(RandomForestWithInstances):

    '''
    Interface to the random forest that takes instance features
    into account.

    Parameters
    ----------
    types: np.ndarray (D)
        Specifies the number of categorical values of an input dimension. Where
        the i-th entry corresponds to the i-th input dimension. Let say we have
        2 dimension where the first dimension consists of 3 different
        categorical choices and the second dimension is continuous than we
        have to pass np.array([2, 0]). Note that we count starting from 0.
    instance_features: np.ndarray (I, K)
        Contains the K dimensional instance features
        of the I different instances
    num_trees: int
        The number of trees in the random forest.
    do_bootstrapping: bool
        Turns on / off bootstrapping in the random forest.
    ratio_features: float
        The ratio of features that are considered for splitting.
    min_samples_split: int
        The minimum number of data points to perform a split.
    min_samples_leaf: int
        The minimum number of data points in a leaf.
    max_depth: int

    eps_purity: float

    max_num_nodes: int

    seed: int
        The seed that is passed to the random_forest_run library
        
    warmstart_models: list
        list of already trained models
